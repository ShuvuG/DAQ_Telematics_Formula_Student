The data acquisition system collected data from the Solartron Metrology LVDT displacement sensor, and a HCSR04 ultrasonic sensor. The sensors were attached to the Arduino Uno microcontrollers. Arduino Uno performed simple mean-value computations and datatype truncations to smoothen any non-linear spikes observed in the data. Sensor readings were then transferred to the raspberry pi at a user-defined sample period via a high- speed CAN 2.0b bus.
Arduino IDE was used primarily to debug and release the application layer scripts to the Arduino Uno microcontrollers. Similarly, PuTTY and Microsoft Visual Studio were used for SSH based remote computing of the raspberry pi. Debugging was performed using 2204A Picoscopes, Wireshark and Arduino Serial monitors.
Upon receiving the CAN bus data, the raspberry pi extracted the relevant sensor information, timestamped the data and made a bulk upload of sensor readings to a ThingSpeak cloud server. This was carried out every 15 seconds. Simultaneously, the data was logged to a CSV file in the raspberry pi SD card. SocketCAN and ThingSpeak application programming interfaces (APIs) were deployed for the purpose. Simple scatter-plotting based codes were written in MATLAB and imported to the ThingSpeak server for data visualisations.
