# DAQ_Telematics_Formula_Student
I built a DAQ and telematics system consisting of ATMega328P microcontrollers, BCM2837 microprocessor and CAN controllers programmed in a deterministic master-slave configuration. I adapted the CANOpen network management, error control, synchronisation, and timestamp protocols to design an active-standby microcontroller pair. I used AWS IoT Greengrass and MATLAB ThingSpeak platforms for telematics, data storage and analysis.
